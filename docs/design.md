# Multi-Agent System Design

## Design Philosophy

The Multi-Agent System is designed around the principle of **specialized expertise with centralized coordination**. Each agent has a specific role and responsibility, while the orchestrator ensures coordinated execution and quality control through critic feedback loops.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Planner**: Focuses solely on breaking down questions into executable steps
- **Researcher**: Specializes in information gathering using appropriate tools
- **Expert**: Concentrates on synthesis and reasoning using calculation tools
- **Critic**: Dedicated to quality assessment and feedback generation
- **Finalizer**: Responsible for final answer synthesis and formatting

### 2. Centralized Control with Distributed Execution
- **Orchestrator**: Single point of control for workflow management
- **Agents**: Specialized execution units with focused responsibilities
- **State Management**: Centralized state with controlled access patterns

### 3. Quality-First Approach
- **Critic Integration**: Every major step is reviewed before proceeding
- **Feedback Loops**: Rejection triggers retry with improved context
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry limits with graceful degradation

### 4. Tool Integration Strategy
- **Subgraph Pattern**: Tool-using agents encapsulated in subgraphs
- **Conversation Preservation**: Tool interactions maintain conversation context
- **Safe Execution**: Restricted tool environments with error handling

## Design Decisions and Rationale

### Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

#### Decision: Use multiple specialized agents instead of a single monolithic agent

**Rationale:**
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent can be optimized for its specific task
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one agent doesn't compromise the entire system
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify or replace individual components
- **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on workload
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify and fix issues in specific components

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Single Agent**: Would be simpler but less specialized and harder to debug
- **Microservices**: Would add unnecessary complexity for this use case
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Would be more rigid and harder to adapt

### Why Centralized Orchestrator?

#### Decision: Use a centralized orchestrator instead of peer-to-peer communication

**Rationale:**
- **Predictable Control Flow**: Clear, deterministic execution sequence
- **Simplified State Management**: Single source of truth for system state
- **Easier Debugging**: Centralized logging and error handling
- **Quality Control**: Centralized critic integration and retry logic
- **Message Routing**: Simplified inter-agent communication

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Would be more complex and harder to debug
- **Event-Driven**: Would add complexity without clear benefits
- **Distributed Orchestration**: Would be overkill for this use case

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros**: Simplicity, predictability, easy debugging
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, less flexibility, potential bottleneck

### Why Critic Feedback Loops?

#### Decision: Include critic agents that review work before proceeding

**Rationale:**
- **Quality Assurance**: Catches errors early in the process
- **Iterative Improvement**: Allows for refinement of work
- **Error Recovery**: Provides feedback for retry attempts
- **Transparency**: Makes decision-making process explicit
- **Learning**: System can improve through feedback

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **No Review**: Would be faster but lower quality
- **Post-Processing Review**: Would catch errors too late
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Would be too complex for this use case

### Why Subgraph Pattern for Tool Usage?

#### Decision: Use LangGraph subgraphs for agents that need tool interaction

**Rationale:**
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with LangChain tool framework
- **Conversation Preservation**: Maintains context during tool interactions
- **Conditional Routing**: Automatic routing between LLM and tool nodes
- **State Isolation**: Tool state isolated from main workflow state
- **Reusability**: Subgraphs can be reused in different contexts

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Direct Tool Calls**: Would lose conversation context
- **Custom Tool Management**: Would require significant custom code
- **External Tool Services**: Would add unnecessary complexity
