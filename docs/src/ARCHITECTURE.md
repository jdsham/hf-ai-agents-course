- **Rationale**: Simplifies coordination, debugging, and state integrity
- **Alternative Considered**: Distributed coordination
- **Rejection Reason**: Increased complexity and synchronization challenges

**Graph-Based Workflow vs. Linear Pipeline:**
- **Decision**: Graph-based workflow (LangGraph) for flexible, conditional routing and modular agent integration
- **Rationale**: Enables complex workflow orchestration and tool integration
- **Alternative Considered**: Linear pipelines
- **Rejection Reason**: Limited extensibility and dynamic workflow control

**Executor-Guard Pattern vs. Multi-Agent Coordination:**
- **Decision**: Streamlined 2-agent system with main executor and embedded guard tool
- **Rationale**: Balances simplicity with dynamic supervision and quality control
- **Alternative Considered**: Complex multi-agent coordination
- **Rejection Reason**: Unnecessary complexity for the problem domain

**Factory Pattern vs. Static Configuration:**
- **Decision**: Factory pattern for dynamic graph creation and configuration injection
- **Rationale**: Enables prompt injection, flexible configuration, and rapid experimentation
- **Alternative Considered**: Static configuration
- **Rejection Reason**: Limited flexibility and experimentation capabilities

### 5.2 Trade-offs and Risks

**Complexity vs. Quality:**
- **Trade-off**: Guard agent and feedback loops add complexity but significantly improve output quality and reliability
- **Mitigation**: Streamlined design and clear component boundaries

**Maintainability vs. Functionality:**
