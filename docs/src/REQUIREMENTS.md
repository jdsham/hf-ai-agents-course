# Multi-Agent System Requirements

## 1. System Overview

The system shall answer GAIA Level 1 questions efficiently and reliably through a streamlined 2-agent architecture with comprehensive tool integration.

- **REQ-001**: The system shall be implemented as a 2-agent system with Executor and Guard agents working together
- **REQ-002**: The system shall support prompt injection at runtime for flexible agent configuration
- **REQ-003**: The system shall achieve at least 30% accuracy on GAIA Level 1 questions

## 2. Architecture

- **REQ-004**: The executor agent shall analyze questions, plan solutions, and execute problem-solving steps using available tools
- **REQ-005**: The executor agent shall maintain context and provide clear reasoning traces throughout the problem-solving process
- **REQ-006**: The guard agent shall provide quality assurance and validation of the executor agent's work
- **REQ-007**: The guard agent shall provide constructive feedback and course correction when needed

## 3. Core Functionality

### Information Gathering
- **REQ-008**: The system shall gather information from web search, Wikipedia, YouTube, and file sources
- **REQ-009**: The system shall process various file formats (PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, text)
- **REQ-010**: The system shall perform mathematical calculations and logical reasoning
- **REQ-011**: The system shall handle tool failures and incomplete information gracefully

### Problem Solving
- **REQ-012**: The executor agent shall break down complex problems into manageable steps
- **REQ-013**: The executor agent shall dynamically select and chain appropriate tools based on task requirements
- **REQ-014**: The executor agent shall synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent answers
- **REQ-015**: The system shall validate solutions through multiple approaches when possible

## 4. Quality Assurance

- **REQ-016**: The guard agent shall review and validate the executor agent's work before providing final answers
- **REQ-017**: The guard agent shall provide proactive course correction during problem-solving
- **REQ-018**: The system shall implement fail-fast error handling with clear error messages
- **REQ-019**: The system shall maintain comprehensive logging through Opik integration

## 5. Output & Configuration

- **REQ-020**: The system shall return answers in JSON format with final_answer and reasoning_trace fields
- **REQ-021**: The system shall process questions in batch mode from input JSONL files
- **REQ-022**: The system shall write answers to output JSONL files with proper formatting
- **REQ-023**: The system shall support configuration of model settings and prompts for both agents

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **REQ-024**: The system shall use Opik-based evaluation methodology for performance assessment
- **REQ-025**: The system shall provide experiment tracking and metrics collection capabilities
- **REQ-026**: The system shall support updating strategies through prompt-based configuration without code changes
- **REQ-027**: The system shall maintain clear separation of concerns between executor and guard agents

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **REQ-028**: The system shall operate within available computational resources and respect external API rate limits
- **REQ-029**: The system shall require Opik server availability for observability and evaluation

### Assumptions
- **REQ-030**: The system assumes internet connectivity, external API availability, English language questions, and GAIA Level 1 dataset availability
