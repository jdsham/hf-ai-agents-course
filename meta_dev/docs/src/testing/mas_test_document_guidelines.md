# Multi-Agent System Unit Test Document Guidelines

## 1. Introduction & Overview
- **Purpose of the document**: Define objectives for testing agent behaviors, interactions, and collective system functionality within the multi-agent system context
- **Scope of testing**: Specify agent communication protocols, decision-making processes, coordination mechanisms, and emergent behaviors that will be tested
- **Testing objectives and goals**: Ensure individual agent correctness, validate inter-agent communication, verify coordination strategies, and test system-level emergent behaviors
- **Overview of the system being tested**: Describe the multi-agent architecture, agent types, communication patterns, and coordination mechanisms

## 2. Test Strategy & Approach
- **Testing methodology**: Unit testing with pytest, plus agent-specific testing frameworks and simulation environments for multi-agent interactions
- **Test environment requirements**: Include MAS-specific tools (e.g., OpenMAS testing utilities), agent simulation environments, and communication protocol testing frameworks
- **Tools and frameworks to be used**: pytest, pytest-mock, agent interaction simulators, message passing validators, and coordination testing utilities
- **Code coverage goals**: Extend beyond standard coverage to include agent communication paths, coordination logic, and interaction scenarios

## 3. Component Inventory
- **Complete list of all components to be tested**: Individual agents, communication protocols, coordination mechanisms, state management systems, and message routing logic
- **Classification of components**: Agent types (planner, researcher, expert, critic, finalizer), communication interfaces, coordination controllers, and utility functions
- **Dependencies between components**: Inter-agent dependencies, message routing dependencies, state synchronization requirements, and coordination dependencies
- **Priority/importance of each component**: Critical agent interactions, core communication protocols, essential coordination logic, and supporting utilities

## 4. Test Specifications for Each Component
For each component, specify:
- **Component Name & Location** (file, line numbers): Include agent type and interaction context
- **Purpose/Functionality** of the component: Focus on agent decision-making, communication behaviors, and coordination responsibilities
- **Input Parameters** and their types: Agent messages, state data, coordination signals, and environmental inputs
- **Expected Output** and return types: Agent responses, state updates, coordination decisions, and communication outputs
- **Dependencies** that need mocking: Other agents, communication protocols, external systems, and coordination mechanisms
- **Test Cases** to be written:
  - Happy path scenarios: Normal agent interactions and successful coordination
  - Edge cases: Boundary conditions in agent communication and coordination
  - Error conditions: Agent failures, communication breakdowns, and coordination conflicts
  - Boundary conditions: System limits, agent capacity constraints, and interaction thresholds

## 5. Mocking & Stubbing Strategy
- **External dependencies to mock**: Other agents, LLMs, file systems, APIs, communication protocols, and coordination systems
- **How to mock each dependency**: Agent interaction simulators, communication protocol mocks, coordination mechanism stubs, and external service mocks
- **Mock data and responses** to use: Agent state snapshots, communication messages, coordination signals, and interaction histories
- **Stubbing strategies** for complex interactions: Multi-agent coordination scenarios, emergent behavior simulation, and system-level interaction patterns

## 6. Test Data & Fixtures
- **Test data requirements**: Agent state data, communication message histories, coordination patterns, and interaction scenarios
- **Fixtures to be created**: Agent interaction scenarios, communication protocol tests, coordination mechanism validations, and system-level behavior tests
- **Sample inputs and expected outputs**: Agent messages, state transitions, coordination decisions, and emergent behaviors
- **Edge case data**: Agent failure scenarios, communication breakdowns, coordination conflicts, and system overload conditions

## 7. Test Organization Structure
- **How tests will be organized** in files: Group by agent types, interaction patterns, coordination mechanisms, and system-level behaviors
- **Naming conventions**: Include agent names, interaction types, coordination scenarios, and test context
- **Test grouping strategy**: Individual agent tests, agent interaction tests, coordination mechanism tests, and system-level integration tests
- **Test execution order**: Consider agent dependencies, coordination sequences, and interaction prerequisites

## 8. Quality Assurance
- **Code coverage requirements**: Agent communication coverage, coordination logic coverage, interaction scenario coverage, and emergent behavior validation
- **Performance benchmarks**: Agent interaction efficiency, communication protocol performance, coordination mechanism speed, and system scalability metrics
- **Test execution time limits**: Account for complex multi-agent scenarios and coordination testing requirements
- **Success criteria**: Individual agent correctness, communication reliability, coordination effectiveness, and emergent behavior validation

## Multi-Agent System Specific Testing Focus

### Pure Functions (easier to test):
- **Validation functions**: Agent message validation, state consistency checks, and coordination rule validation
- **Utility functions**: Agent state transformation, communication message formatting, and coordination signal processing
- **Data transformation functions**: Agent state updates, message routing logic, and coordination data processing

### Agent Logic (with heavy mocking):
- **Agent state management**: Individual agent state transitions, state consistency across agents, and state synchronization
- **Message routing**: Inter-agent communication paths, message delivery validation, and routing logic testing
- **Orchestration logic**: Multi-agent coordination, task allocation, and system-level workflow management

### External Integrations (fully mocked):
- **LLM interactions**: Agent decision-making processes, response generation, and reasoning validation
- **File system operations**: Agent data persistence, state storage, and configuration management
- **Network calls**: Inter-agent communication protocols, external service integration, and coordination mechanisms

### Configuration & Setup:
- **Agent configuration**: Individual agent setup, parameter validation, and configuration consistency
- **Graph construction**: Multi-agent system architecture, agent interconnection, and coordination structure
- **Tool initialization**: Agent capability setup, communication protocol initialization, and coordination mechanism setup

## Key Principles for Multi-Agent System Testing

1. **Focus on Behavior, Not Implementation**: Test agent behaviors, interaction patterns, and coordination strategies rather than internal implementation details
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Mock other agents, communication protocols, and external services to isolate individual agent testing
3. **Test Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling of agent failures, communication breakdowns, and coordination conflicts
4. **Test State Management**: Verify agent state consistency, state synchronization across agents, and state transition correctness
5. **Test Message Flow**: Ensure messages flow correctly between agents, validate communication protocols, and test routing logic
6. **Test Coordination Mechanisms**: Validate task allocation, synchronization strategies, and conflict resolution processes
7. **Test Emergent Behaviors**: Assess system-level behaviors that arise from agent interactions and ensure they meet requirements
8. **Test Scalability**: Validate system performance as the number of agents increases and identify potential bottlenecks
