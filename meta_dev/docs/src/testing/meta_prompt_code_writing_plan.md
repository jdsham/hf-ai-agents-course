# Comprehensive Testing Implementation Plan Request

I need you to analyze the TESTING.md document and create a detailed, phased implementation plan for writing ALL test files and test code described in that document. The plan should be broken down into focused, manageable phases that can be executed independently.

## Requirements for the Plan:

### Phase Structure
Each phase should include:
1. **Phase Name and Number** (e.g., "Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup")
2. **Specific Deliverables** (exact files to create/modify with file paths)
3. **Dependencies** (what phases must be completed before this one)
4. **Estimated Scope** (number of test files, functions, or complexity level)
5. **Success Criteria** (specific, measurable completion indicators)
6. **Detailed Tasks** (step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done)
7. **TESTING.md References** (specific sections from TESTING.md that inform this phase)

### Phase Guidelines
- **Keep phases small and focused** - each phase should be completable in a single session
- **Logical progression** - follow testing best practices (infrastructure → unit → integration → system)
- **Clear dependencies** - avoid circular dependencies between phases
- **Measurable outcomes** - each phase should have clear completion criteria
- **Reference TESTING.md** - each phase should reference specific sections from the TESTING.md document

### Example Phase Types
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Creating folder structures, conftest.py, fixtures
- **Single File Implementation**: Writing tests for one specific component
- **Component Group**: Writing tests for related components (e.g., all validation utilities)
- **Integration Layer**: Writing tests for component interactions
- **System Level**: Writing end-to-end workflow tests

### Plan Format
Present the plan as a numbered list of phases, where each phase includes:
- Phase title and description
- File paths and specific deliverables
- Dependencies (list of phase numbers)
- Scope estimate
- Success criteria
- Detailed task breakdown
- TESTING.md section references

## After Plan Creation
Once you create the plan, I will ask you to execute specific phases one at a time by referencing the phase number and title.

## Constraints
- Do NOT start implementing any tests yet
- Focus ONLY on creating the comprehensive plan
- Ensure each phase is independently executable
- Consider the existing codebase structure and testing framework preferences (pytest)
- Account for the complexity and scope described in TESTING.md
- Reference specific sections from TESTING.md to provide proper context

Please analyze the TESTING.md document and create this phased implementation plan.
