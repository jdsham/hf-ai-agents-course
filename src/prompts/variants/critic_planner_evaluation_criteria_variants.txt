Consider whether the plan addresses all aspects of the question and provides a clear path to resolution. Reject if any improvements are needed.

## Variant 3: Strategic Evaluation Criteria
Assess the plan strategically for its effectiveness in addressing the question. Approve only if the plan provides a clear and effective strategy for gathering information and analyzing it. Consider the strategic value of each research and expert step. Reject if the strategy could be improved.

## Variant 4: Systematic Evaluation Criteria
